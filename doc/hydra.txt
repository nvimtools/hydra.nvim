This is the Neovim implementation of the famous Emacs Hydra
<https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra> package.


==============================================================================
1. Description for Poets                         *hydra-description-for-poets*

Once you summon the Hydra through the prefixed binding (the body + any one
head), all heads can be called in succession with only a short extension.

The Hydra is vanquished once Hercules, any binding that isn’t the Hydra’s
head, arrives. Note that Hercules, besides vanquishing the Hydra, will still
serve his original purpose, calling his proper command. This makes the Hydra
very seamless.


==============================================================================
2. Description for Pragmatics               *hydra-description-for-pragmatics*

Imagine you want to change the size of your current window. Vim allows you to
do it with `<C-w>+`, `<C-w>-`, `<C-w><`, `<C-w>>` bindings. So, you have to
press `<C-w>+<C-w>+<C-w>+<C-w><<C-w><<C-w><...` as many times as you need (I
know about count prefixes, but I was never fond of them). Hydra allows you to
press `<C-w>` just once and then get access to any `<C-w>...` bindings without
pressing the prefix again: `<C-w>+++++--<<<<`. Or buffer side scrolling:
instead of `zlzlzlzlzlzl...` press `zlllllllllhhhl` to freely scroll buffer
left and right. Any key other than bind to a hydra will stop hydra state and do
what they should.

Hydra also allows assigning a custom hint to such group of keybindings to
allows you an easy glance at what you can do.

If you want to quickly understand the concept, you can watch the original Emacs
Hydra video demo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qZliI1BKzI>


==============================================================================
3. Installation                                           *hydra-installation*

To install with lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim> use:

>lua
    {
        "nvimtools/hydra.nvim",
        config = function()
            -- create hydras in here
        end
    }
<


==============================================================================
4. Creating a New Hydra                           *hydra-creating-a-new-hydra*

To create a hydra you need to call Hydra’s constructor with a parameters
table of the form:

>lua
    local Hydra = require("hydra")
    Hydra({
        -- string? only used in auto-generated hint
        name = "Hydra's name",
    
        -- string | string[] modes where the hydra exists, same as `vim.keymap.set()` accepts
        mode = "n",
    
        -- string? key required to activate the hydra, when excluded, you can use
        -- Hydra:activate()
        body = "<leader>o",
    
        -- these are explained below
        hint = [[ ... ]],
        config = { ... },
        heads = { ... },
    })
<

The more complex fields are described below:

- |hydra-hint|
- |hydra-config|
- |hydra-heads|


==============================================================================
5. Config                                                       *hydra-config*

With this table, you can set the behavior of the whole hydra.

>lua
    config = {
        -- see :h hydra-heads
        exit = false, -- set the default exit value for each head in the hydra
    
        -- decides what to do when a key which doesn't belong to any head is pressed
        --   nil: hydra exits and foreign key behaves normally, as if the hydra wasn't active
        --   "warn": hydra stays active, issues a warning and doesn't run the foreign key
        --   "run": hydra stays active, runs the foreign key
        foreign_keys = nil,
    
        -- see `:h hydra-colors`
        color = "red", -- "red" | "amaranth" | "teal" | "pink"
    
        -- define a hydra for the given buffer, pass `true` for current buf
        buffer = nil,
    
        -- when true, summon the hydra after pressing only the `body` keys. Normally a head is
        -- required
        invoke_on_body = false,
    
        -- description used for the body keymap when `invoke_on_body` is true
        desc = nil, -- when nil, "[Hydra] .. name" is used
    
        -- see :h hydra-hooks
        on_enter = nil, -- called when the hydra is activated
        on_exit = nil, -- called before the hydra is deactivated
        on_key = nil, -- called after every hydra head
    
        -- timeout after which the hydra is automatically disabled. Calling any head
        -- will refresh the timeout
        --   true: timeout set to value of 'timeoutlen' (:h 'timeoutlen')
        --   5000: set to desired number of milliseconds
        timeout = false, -- by default hydras wait forever
    
        -- see :h hydra-hint-hint-configuration
        hint = false,
    }
<


DEFAULT CONFIGURATION                     *hydra-config-default-configuration*

The above discusses per-hydra configuration. But Hydra.nvim also allows you to
set default values for the `config` table. These defaults are automatically
applied to new hydras, but can still be overridden on a per-hydra basis.

This is useful for setting config that you want to apply to all of your hydras,
like common floating window borders, or common hooks.

_Only applies to hydras that are created after you call the setup method_

>lua
    require('hydra').setup({
        debug = false,
        exit = false,
        foreign_keys = nil,
        color = "red",
        timeout = false,
        invoke_on_body = false,
        hint = {
            show_name = true,
            position = { "bottom" },
            offset = 0,
            float_opts = { },
        },
        on_enter = nil,
        on_exit = nil,
        on_key = nil,
    })
<


==============================================================================
6. Hint                                                           *hydra-hint*

The hint for a hydra can let you know that it’s active, and remind you of the
hydra’s heads.

The string for the hint is passed directly to the hydra:

>lua
    Hydra({
        hint = [[ some multiline string ]]
    })
<

By default, a one line hint is generated and displayed in the cmdline. Heads
and their descriptions are placed in the order they were passed into the
`heads` table. Heads with `{ opts = { desc = false }}` don’t appear in
auto-generated hints.

Values in the hint string are parsed with the following rules:

- anything between `_` is considered a head, and will be highlighted with the
    corresponding head |hydra-color|.
- `^` is treated as an empty char and can be used to help align the hint (normally used
    on lines that don’t have as many underscores as lines above or below)
- `%{val}` is a dynamic value, a function named `val` is called and its return value
    inserted into the hint
    - Updated each time a head is called
    - Pass these functions to `config.hint.funcs` (discussed below)
    - There are built-in functions located
        here <https://github.com/nvimtools/hydra.nvim/blob/main/lua/hydra/hint/vim-options.lua>

**Heads not in the manually created hint, will be automatically added to the
bottom of the hint window, following the same rules as auto-generated hint. You
can avoid this with { desc = false }**


HINT CONFIGURATION                             *hydra-hint-hint-configuration*

The hint is configured with the `hint` key on the |hydra-config| table. You can
disable the hint by setting this value to `false`.

>lua
    Hydra({
        config = {
            -- either a table like below, or `false` to disable the hint
            hint = {
                -- "window" | "cmdline" | "statusline" | "statuslinemanual"
                --   "window": show hint in a floating window
                --   "cmdline": show hint in the echo area
                --   "statusline": show auto-generated hint in the status line
                --   "statuslinemanual": Do not show a hint, but return a custom status
                --                       line hint from require("hydra.statusline").get_hint()
                type = "window", -- defaults to "window" if `hint` is passed to the hydra
                                 -- otherwise defaults to "cmdline"
    
                -- set the position of the hint window. one of:
                --    top-left   |   top    |  top-right
                --  -------------+----------+--------------
                --   middle-left |  middle  | middle-right
                --  -------------+----------+--------------
                --   bottom-left |  bottom  | bottom-right
                position = "bottom",
    
                -- Offset of the floating window from the nearest editor border
                offset = 0,
    
                -- options passed to `nvim_open_win()`, see :h nvim_open_win()
                -- Lets you set border, header, footer, etc etc.
                float_opts = {
                    -- row, col, height, width, relative, and anchor should not be
                    -- overridden
                    style = "minimal",
                    focusable = false,
                    noautocmd = true,
                },
    
                -- show the hydras name (or "HYDRA:" if not given a name), at the
                -- beginning of an auto-generated hint
                show_name = true,
                
                -- if set to true, this will prevent the hydra's hint window from displaying
                -- immediately.
                -- Note: you can still show the window manually by calling Hydra.hint:show()
                -- and manually close it with Hydra.hint:close()
                hide_on_load = false,
    
                -- Table from function names to function. Functions should return
                -- a string. These functions can be used in hints with %{func_name}
                -- more in :h hydra-hint
                funcs = {},
            }
        }
    })
<


==============================================================================
7. Heads                                                         *hydra-heads*

Each Hydra’s head has the form:

>lua
    { head, rhs, opts }
<

Similar to the `vim.keymap.set()` function.

The `head` is the "lhs" of the mapping (given as a string). These are the keys
you press to perform the action.

The `rhs` is the action that gets performed. It can be a string, function or
`nil`. when nil, the action is a no-op.

The `opts` table is empty by default.

>lua
    opts = {
        -- "When the hydra hides, this head does not stick out"
        -- Private heads are unreachable outside of the hydra state.
        private = false,
    
        -- When true, stops the hydra after executing this head
        -- NOTE:
        --   - All exit heads are private
        --   - If no exit head is specified, esc is set by default
        exit = false,
    
        -- Like exit, but stops the hydra BEFORE executing the command
        exit_before = false,
    
        -- when set to false, config.on_key isn't run after this head
        ok_key = true,
    
        -- string | false - value shown in auto-generated hint. When false, this key
        -- doesn't show up in the auto-generated hint
        desc = nil,
    
        -- same as the builtin map options
        expr = false, -- :h :map-expression
        silent = false, -- :h :map-silent
    
        -- \/ For Pink Hydras only \/ --
    
        -- allows binding a key which will immediately perform its action and not wait
        -- `timeoutlen` for a possible continuation
        nowait = false,
    
        -- Override `mode` for this head
        mode = "n",
    }
<


==============================================================================
8. Colors                                                       *hydra-colors*

The `color` option is a shortcut for determining the `exit` and `foreign_keys`
options. It sets them in the following way:

  color      values
  ---------- ------------------------------------
  red        
  blue       exit = true
  amaranth   foreign_keys = ‘warn’
  teal       foreign_keys = ‘warn’, exit = true
  pink       foreign_keys = ‘run’

  [!NOTE] `Color` has higher precedence than the `exit` and `foreign_keys`
  options. If the values specified in the `exit` or `foreign_keys` options
  conflict with the ones implied by `color`, the `exit` or `foreign_keys` options
  are ignored.
Colors are also used to highlight heads in the hint, so you know how they will
behave.

Each hydra head has a _basic_ associated color, red or blue, that determines
whether or not the hydra will continue after the head is called:

- reddish head will execute the command and continue the state
- blueish head will execute the command and stop the state

The hydra body can be one of five variants of the basic colors: amaranth, teal,
pink, red, blue. They (according to basic color) determine the default behavior
of all the heads; and determine what happens when a foreign key is pressed. The
following table summarizes the effects of the different colors.

  Body Color   Basic color   Executing NON-HEAD      Executing HEAD
  ------------ ------------- ----------------------- ----------------
  amaranth     red           Disallow and Continue   Continue
  teal         blue          Disallow and Continue   Quit
  pink         red           Allow and Continue      Continue
  red          red           Allow and Quit          Continue
  blue         blue          Allow and Quit          Quit

AMARANTH                                               *hydra-colors-amaranth*

The amaranth color wasn’t chosen at random just because it is a variation of
the color red. There is some lore — according to Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth>:


  The word amaranth comes from the Greek word amaranton, meaning "unwilting"
  (from the verb marainesthai, meaning "wilt"). The word was applied to amaranth
  because it did not soon fade and so symbolized immortality.
Hydras with amaranth body are impossible to quit with any binding except a blue
head.


BLUE AND TEAL                                     *hydra-colors-blue-and-teal*

A blue hydra has little sense in Vim since it works exactly like standard Vim
multi-key keybinding with addition you can add a custom hint to it.

A teal hydra works the same way, except it blocks all keys which are not hydra
heads, which can be useful.


PINK                                                       *hydra-colors-pink*

Pink hydra is of a different nature. It is a key-layer
<https://github.com/nvimtools/hydra.nvim/tree/main/lua/hydra/layer> inside, so
all keys except overwritten are work as usual. Even `[count]` prefixes.


==============================================================================
9. Hooks                                                         *hydra-hooks*

There are three hooks currently, `on_enter`, `on_exit`, and `on_key`. These
fire when you’d expect, and they’re set on a per hydra basis. The
`on_enter` function is called in such a way that gives you access to
|hydra-meta-accessors|.


META ACCESSORS                                    *hydra-hooks-meta-accessors*

Inside a function passed as `on_enter`, the `vim.o`, `vim.go`, `vim.bo` and
`vim.wo` meta-accessors
<https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide#using-meta-accessors> are redefined
to work the way you think they should. If you want some option value to be
temporary changed while Hydra is active, you need just set it with one of the
meta-accessors in the `on_enter` function… and that’s it. No need to set it
back in `on_exit` function.

>lua
    config = {
        on_enter = function()
           print('Hydra enter')
           vim.bo.modifiable = false -- temporarily set `nomodifiable` while Hydra is active
        end,
        on_exit = function()
           print('Hydra exit')
           -- No need to set modifiable back here
        end
    }
<


==============================================================================
10. Public methods                                      *hydra-public-methods*

- `Hydra:activate()` — activate the hydra programmatically
- `Hydra:exit()` — exit the hydra if it is active


==============================================================================
11. Highlights                                              *hydra-highlights*

Hydra defines these highlight groups with their defaults colors:

- `HydraRed` — `fg = #FF5733`
- `HydraBlue` — `fg = #5EBCF6`
- `HydraAmaranth` — `fg = #ff1757`
- `HydraTeal` — `fg = #00a1a1`
- `HydraPink` — `fg = #ff55de`
- `HydraHint` — linked to `NormalFloat`, defines the fore- and background of
    the hint window;
- `HydraBorder` — linked to `FloatBorder`, defines the fore- and background of
    the border.
- `HydraTitle` — linked to `FloatTitle`, hl for the window title
- `HydraFooter` — linked to `FloatFooter`, hl for the window footer (only in
    nvim 0.10.0+)


==============================================================================
12. Keymap Utility Functions                  *hydra-keymap-utility-functions*

Utility functions to use in keymaps, required with
`require("hydra.keymap-util")`

- `cmd(command)`
    Get a string and wrap it in `<Cmd>`, `<CR>`
    >lua
        cmd("vsplit") == "<Cmd>vsplit<CR>"
    <
- `pcmd(try_cmd, catch?, catch_cmd?)`
    Protected `cmd`. Examples explain better:
    >
        pcmd("wincmd k", "E11", "close")

13. Statusline                                              *hydra-statusline*

In the statusline module `require('hydra.statusline')` there are functions that
can help you to integrate Hydra in your statusline:

- `is_active()` — returns `true` if there is an active hydra;
- `get_name()` — get the name of an active hydra if it has it;
- `get_color()` — get the color of an active hydra;
- `get_hint()` — get an active hydra’s statusline hint. Return not `nil` only when
    `config.hint` is set to `false` or when `config.hint.type == "statuslinemanual"`

14. Limitations                                            *hydra-limitations*

`[count]` is not supported in a red, amaranth and teal hydras (see `:help
count`). But supported in pink hydra since it is a layer
<https://github.com/nvimtools/hydra.nvim/tree/main/lua/hydra/layer>.
